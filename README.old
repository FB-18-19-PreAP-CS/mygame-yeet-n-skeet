# MyGame Project Requirements

## First things first
You can use the [Pygame](http://www.pygame.org) library for implementing your game.  You should start by getting Pygame setup: follow the instructions at [Getting Started](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted).  

You also may want to take a look at some of the examples given on the [tutorials](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/tutorials) page.

## Before you start coding

### Group Roles and Responsibilities
Each member of the group will have at least one role:
* Communications director - Sends Mr. Purdy and the group progress updates.
* Group coordinator - Keeps the group on track, keeping scope in mind and ensuring all group members are fulfilling the responsibilities of their role
* Resources manager - Ensures that the group's repository is kept up to date.  Handles merge conflicts.
* Clarifying specialist - Gets clarifications and passes them on when needed.  This includes finding useful tutorials for Pygame. 

**Full disclosure: I (Mr. Purdy) am NOT a game developer!  You will have to figure out a LOT of things for yourselves on this project...because of that, you will probably LEARN a LOT!**

While you don't need to fully plan out your game before starting, you and your group should at least have an *idea* of what you want to create.  Before you start any programming, send an e-mail to everyone in your group and me outlining your plans.  These plans should include:
* How many players?
* Setting?
* Basic gameplay loop (that is, what will the player(s) be doing, what is the goal, how does the game end)?
* A list of milestones, or goals, and how long you think each milestone will take
    * You have approximately 5 weeks to complete this project, so if your outline  shows you finishing in 3-4 weeks, you're probably on track!
    * Things generally take longer than you think they will
    * You can always add additional features if you have time
    * You can always cut features if you don't have time

Every **Friday** during this project, you (your group) will send an e-mail to everyone in your group and me detailing what each group member completed that week, what milestones were completed, and any changes to your overall plans.  This e-mail **will be** a grade.  

## Game Requirements
* Include graphics (sprites, backgrounds, etc.)
* Allow for user input via keyboard, mouse, controller, etc.
* Movement/animations
* Include sound (background music, sound effects, etc.)
* Have some kind of scoring mechanism
* Clear and complete documentation, including links to any code sources that are used
* Be varied, ie. every time you play it is somehow different
* Be entertaining and attractive
* Be your own creation.

You may also choose to include multiple levels, game modes, etc.

## Game Manual Requirements
Your game manual will be in the form of a `README.md` file.  You will need to rename these instructions `README.old` and create a new file `README.md`.  You can look at this file and past project `README.md` files to get an idea of how to format your manual.  There are also many many resources online for using Github Markdown.

Your manual should include (at least) the following:
* Includes a back-story or setting for the game
* Include an explanation of the main "gameplay loop":
    * how do you play?
    * what is the goal?
    * when does the game end?
* Includes all user inputs and explanations
* Includes screenshots and other graphics
* Free from typographical and grammatical mistakes
* Includes any outside sources (references) that were used for ideas or graphics.

## Grading
The following grades will be taken over the course of this project:
### Minor Grades:
* Weekly update e-mails (Fridays) x 4
* Weekly peer feedback surveys (on-task behavior, productivity, group contributions) x 4
* Classmate reviews of your game
* Daily work (5 points per week) x 4
    * If I have to remind your group to get back to work you will lose these points

### Major Grades:
* Initial game description e-mail
* Final peer review of your overall work over the course of the project
* The game manual
* The game itself
    * Will be graded based on meeting the requirements outlined above and agreed upon in class.
