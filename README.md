 <h1> YEET 'N SKEET GAME MANUAL <img src="Dave transparent.png" alt="" </h1>

   <h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
    In a lush, mountainous region in Wales, two teens, Yeet and Skeet, walk at a park with their beloved dog, Dave, to try out their brand new jet packs at a good space.
    One day, the three go far off the beaten path, and venture deeper into the terrain. Until they become lost in the woods, the teens stop and rest only to realize they lost Dave! The two boys determine to retrace their tracks quickly as possible in hopes to find their dog. Once Dave is spotted the two boys decide to have a little fun and race to retrieve Dave. Come along to help Yeet and Skeet get to Dave!
